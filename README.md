# Final year project
Multiplayer game with procedurally generated levels that uses 3D graphics, a top-down perspective at a set angle and is developed using the Unity engine and the C# programming language.
The game is meant to be played by multiple players that are tasked to complete a number of objectives in a given time, all while avoiding an enemy that chases them. At each run, the players have to explore a newly generated level. There is a safe zone the enemy can not enter. While the players are outside the safe zone, the chance that the enemy will chase them increases, and while they are inside the safe zone, the chance will decrease. This way, the players are encouraged to explore the level and then find the way back to the safe zone. If a player is caught by the enemy, then they lose the game. If the time limit is exceeded, then all players lose the game. If all objectives are completed within the time limit, then all remaining players win.
